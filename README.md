# dotfiles (online use such as GitPod)

My set of dotfiles. Obviously totally subjective but I think they are good defaults if you do the same kind of work.

Assumes you run Mac, but should work fine for Linux given some small configuration changes.

## Important prep steps

1. **Before you do anything**, make sure to add your own `username` (usually `firstnamelastname`) at `export USERNAME=` in `/config/.zshrc`.

2. **Navigate to the root (`~`) of your computer and run the scripts, as the scripts assume you are at root level!**
